# Building a Strong Job Search Foundation

Finding a new career in iOS or web development takes time and effort. It involves research, active outreach, tracking progress, building a personal brand, and more.

## Accept That the Job Search Isn’t Easy

Finding a job as a web developer is a full-time job. Understand that hiring managers **will not** discover you if you stay inside your apartment. You need to put yourself out there — physically and online. 


An effective job search involves (but isn’t limited to): 

* In-person networking

* Sending emails

* Arranging informal coffee meetings

* Building an online presence through social media and blogging

* Creating side projects you can add to your portfolio 

* Phone interviews

* Code challenges

* Continued learning

Landing a full-time job is your responsibility. While there are tons of career resources (like this one) that can act as a guide, at the end of the day it comes down to one person: you. You’re the only one that can go on interviews and get the job offer.

It’s no one’s job to *give* you a job. Instead, you must prove your value to an employer as well as convey your genuine interest every step of the way. If you fail to demonstrate your value and interest, employers will move on.

There are always ups and downs as well as rejection when pursuing something new and exciting. However, as Henry Ford famously said, “Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off your goal.” As you go through the job search, focus on your end-goal: a new career as a software engineer. 

## Landing a Job Takes More than Technical Skill

After wrapping up the Full Stack Web Development Program, you now have a strong foundation of technological skills. You have an understanding of programming fundamentals, object orientation, Ruby, JavaScript, and more — all of which employers find desirable when hiring software engineers.

However, having these technical skills alone is not enough to secure a job. There are other behaviors and soft skills that employers look for in a candidate.

Some of the key ones include: 
*Appearance* - Or, the first impression you make. This includes the clothing you wear and your body language (making eye contact, speaking with confidence). 

*Positive attitude* - Do you seem like a team player? Easy to work with? Have an overall positive disposition? 

*Communication* - Listening, writing, and speaking effectively. Essentially, how well you can explain your ideas. 

*Time management* - Do you respond to emails and related in a reasonable amount of time? Does it seem like you can handle multiple responsibilities at once and set appropriate deadlines around them? 

Realize that these traits and soft skills can be even more important than your technical know-how. Because while you can be trained to learn new technical skills, your personality is unchanging.

## Ways to be Proactive in Your Job Hunt

Below are activities that define a proactive job search.

* Schedule time in your calendar for specific job search related tasks. I.e. 1 hour to research open positions, 2 hours emailing new and existing contacts, another 30 minutes following up, etc.  

* Research job openings, companies you want to work for, and people you already know (or have mutual connections with) that work at those companies. 

* Attend in-person networking events (meetups, conferences, association meetings, etc.) 

* Join online groups around a particular interest/industry. Example: a Ruby on Rails LinkedIn group.

* Create an online presence by using social media (like LinkedIn and Twitter) as well as starting to blog.

* Consider volunteering your web development skills for an organization you care about (something you can add to your LinkedIn/portfolio!) 

* Build mini apps (aka “side projects”) that people can actually use and find value from (another thing you can add to your LinkedIn/portfolio) .

* Prepare answers to common interview questions you may be asked. 

* Practice code challenges as a way to prepare for interviews 

## Networking FAQs

**“How do I make small talk?”** In general asking, “What are you working on right now?” is a great way to get a conversation going with anyone from CEOs to fellow developers. 

However, at a networking event, a great way to break the ice is by using the situation. Example: “So, how long have you been going to this Ruby on Rails meetup?” or “Wasn’t that last speaker great?!” When you’re making small talk, don’t make it all about you, show that you’re interested in the other person. Try to find ways to help people. It doesn’t have to be big. Suggest an idea, or offer to introduce them to a contact at a company where you know someone, or recommend a programming book or your favorite meetup. When you help someone, they will naturally want to return the favor. (Aka “pay it forward”.) 

**“What should I do if I am shy?”** When it comes to networking events and even one-on-one meetings, try to schedule them all on the same day of the week. This way, you can relax afterwards. (If being around people exhausts you.) Another way to make yourself feel at ease is by making it about the other person. (Especially when at a networking event.) When you do this by asking questions about them and offering help, it puts less pressure on you having to talk about yourself. And you’ll be much more likeable. (It’s flattering to have another person take interest in your life/work!) 

**“What if evenings don’t work for me?”** Whether you have small children at home or don’t drink alcohol (and therefore don’t enjoy happy hours/”getting drinks after work”) - ask for a lunch/coffee date instead. When it comes to attending networking events, you can try to go to breakfasts before the workday begins. (If you live in a city, there is most likely some kind of breakfast meetup near you, and many breakfast meetups are attended by people are employed -- those are the people you want to meet.) 

## Employers Want to Hire People They Like 

Because you’ll be spending a lot of time together and with the rest of the team, hiring managers want to make sure you can get along with others. Are you pleasant to be around? Can you make small talk? Are you easy to hang out with? 

There is a test often used in the world of recruiting and HR called [“The Airport Test”](https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-airport-test-the-interview-assessment-you-didnt-know-you-were-getting). Essentially, the employer asking themselves, “Would I want to be stuck in an airport with this person?” 

Keep this in mind during every stage of the job search process — from initial contact down to the in-house interview and even job offer.
